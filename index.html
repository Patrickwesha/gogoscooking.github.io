We hope you're hungry and are ready to try new foods. Gogo's cooking has been making popular Zimbabwean cuisine since 2007 and we welcome you to drop by. The menu was inspired by the food my mom, gogo Kwesha, cooked for me and my siblings growing up. In Shona (Zimbabwe’s native tongue) the name ‘gogo’ stands for grandmother. Our restaurant is Located in Dallas, Texas.

We have an authentic Zimbabwean atmosphere that makes you feel as if you are in Zimbabwe. Come visit us for breakfast, lunch, or dinner and eat in our Zimbabwean-themed Hut.
